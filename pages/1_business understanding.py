# Business understanding
## Determine business objectives

Your first task as data analyst is to completely understand what, your possible customer wants to accomplish.
Since the customer often has competing goals and constraints, you have to differ between more and less meaningful
factors, which are influencing the possible outcome.

#### Business objectives
The primary objective is to provide a tutorial on how to build your own computer vision model.
'''
'''
#### Business success criteria
The project has a useful outcome if the user of this app can build a computer vision model from scratch.
'''

'''
## Assess situation
The next step is to get a more detailed look at the resources, constraints, assumptions and other factors that
are influencing the goal and project plan.

#### Inventory of Resources
'''
'''
Our available resources are the following:  
- the given data samples
- IDE as developer interface
- gitbook as front end
#### Requirements, Assumptions and Constraints

#### Risks and Contingencies
Misjudging by the data model into wrong categories, as well as wrongly categorizing as trash.
'''
'''
## Determine data mining goals
#### Data mining goals & success criteria
The data mining goal is to categorize trash on a given image.


## Produce project plan 
In order to achieve the data mining goals and the connected business goals to them you have to 
describe an intended plan, in which you are describing the required steps for the rest of the project.
#### Project Plan

#### Initial Assessment of tools and techniques
In order to achieve our goals we will use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). More about that in the 
later stages of the tutorial.
