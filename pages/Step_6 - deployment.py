# Deployment
'''

'''
## Plan deployment
Determine a strategy for deployment based on the evaluation results. Document it here if you have identified
a general procedure.

#### Deployment plan
This tutorial is hosted on streamlit for free. Thus it is for free the tutorial can be done by every visitor of 
this site.

## Plan monitoring and maintenance
If the data mining result becomes part of the business, proper monitoring and maintenance avoids running into
the incorrect usage of data mining results. Constructing a plan to monitor the deployment of the data mining
results is recommended.
#### Monitoring and maintenance plan
Actually in this project there is no concrete plan for monitoring and maintenance. This tutorial is a simple introduction to 
building computer vision models. No high-stake buisness objectives rely on this project. Of course when streamlit reports
an error we try to maintain the project and keep it alive.

## Produce final report
Writing a final report - whether it includes only a summary of the project, or a final and comprehensive report -
is the next step.
#### Final report
The final results we gathered could be better. There is still room for improvement in terms of classifying the objects correctly into the given classes, as well 
as determining the objects with more confidence into the correct classes. So there are the three following options regarding our project:
- Improve the algorithm
- Take the given algorithm
- Cancelling the project
As you read in the previous step evaluation, we are happy with the results and determine that the project creating a tutorial for working with datasets was a success.
#### Final presentation
Can be attended on friday the 8th of July

## Review project
Last but not least, gather what went wrong, what went right, find room for improvements and what was done well.
#### Experience documentation
In this project the most significant problem is that the predictions of the buildt model is not as high as expected. 
This is where definetly is room for improvement but it is even more important that people who use this app as tutorial
get an overview of important topics regarding
computer vision projects like:
- how do I understand my data
- how do I prepare data for modelling, including data augmentation and splitting the data into useful train and validation sets
- how do I model my own computer vision model
