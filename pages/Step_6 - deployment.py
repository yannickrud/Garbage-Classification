a general procedure.

#### Deployment plan

## Plan monitoring and maintenance
If the data mining result becomes part of the business, proper monitoring and maintenance avoids running into
the incorrect usage of data mining results. Constructing a plan to monitor the deployment of the data mining
results is recommended.

## Produce final report
Writing a final report - whether it includes only a summary of the project, or a final and comprehensive report -
is the next step.
#### Final report
The final results we gathered could be better. There is still room for improvement in terms of classifying the objects correctly into the given classes, as well 
as determining the objects with more confidence into the correct classes. So there are the three following options regarding our project:
- Improve the algorithm
- Take the given algorithm
- Cancelling the project
As you read in the previous step evaluation, we are happy with the results and determine that the project creating a tutorial for working with datasets was a success.
#### Final presentation
Can be attended on friday the 8th of July
