## Evaluate Results
Evaluate whether the results are fitting with the business objectives or if the results are deficient.
If time and money is left, you can test the models partly in the real application. The evaluation of the
data mining results can be used on models which are related to the original business objectives, as well
as on models which are not necessarily related to the original business objectives - possibly unveiling additional 
challenges, information or hints for future directions.

#### Assessment of data mining results with respect to business success criteria
Since we have met our business plan goals the project can be evaluated as success.

#### Approved models
The generated models that met the selected criteria became approved models.

## Review process
A deeper analysis of the data mining engagement to catch overlooked important factors, as well as asking yourself
the questions:
- Did I build the model correctly?
- Did we use any prohibited attributes?
- Are the used attributes suitable for future analyses?

#### Review of process

## Determine next steps
Now you have to decide - based on the previous evaluation results - whether you finish the project or set up 
new data mining projects. Factors such as remaining resources and budget should also be analyzed since they are 
influencing the decision.
